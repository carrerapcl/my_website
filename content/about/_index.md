## My story

I am a Spanish engineer who just moved to London to attend the *Masters in Financial  Analysis* at **London Business School**.

Before starting the [MFA programme](<https://www.london.edu/masters-degrees/masters-in-financial-analysis>), I worked at Deloitte in the Global IFRS & Offerings Services team for a year, in Madrid. Then, I moved to a senior position in the Financial Services Consulting department at KPMG.

### Origins

However, I am not from Madrid. I was raised in a middle-class family close to Vigo, the biggest city in the region of Galicia, in the northwest of Spain. I had a lovely childhood there, but I wanted to live in London since the first time I visited the city, being 12 years old. Still, I really love Galicia, and I would like to enjoy its great summer weather every year, regardless the place in the world where I am living at any moment.

### University

I studied industrial engineering at University of Vigo, and that was a very defining stage of my life, as I met incredibly talented people, started my now four-years long relationship with my girlfriend Sira, and participated in great projects, such as:

- Co-founded UVigo's *Formula Student* team, raised funds (around 80k per season) for it by starting up a company where we offered advertising services targeting the student community. Formula Student is an international engineering competition where students must desging, fund and manufacture a formula-type race car, and compete all over the world while being judged by industry executives.

- Management team of the university's employment forum.

- Research and consulting assistant for a professor's consulting group, writing my Bachelor thesis "Profitability model for the e-grocery business" based on a real consulting project with one of the leader supermarket chains in Spain, and receiving a national award for best thesis in supply chain management.

- UVigo's rugby team player (I really love rugby).

Overall, I think I am a pretty common, easy-going person, trying to live pleasant and meaningfully. That is why my career is very important for me, but also my relationships and my time.
