title: Starting my own blog (coming soon!)

Hello Internet, hello everybody,

This is just a quick post to inaugurate what I will try it to be my blog. The photo you see are the beautiful Cies Islands, in Vigo, my hometown in the Northwest of Spain.

For now, I will just share a quote that I really love, from my admired Isaac Asimov:

> People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do.

See you in the incoming posts!
